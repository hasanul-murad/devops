<B>Automation using Cloud Build</B>


Cloud Build uses build triggers to enable CI/CD automations. You can configure triggers to listen for incoming events, such as when a new commit is pushed to a repository or when a pull request is initiated, and then automatically invoke a build when new events come in.

You will create a trigger and configure that trigger to invoke a build anytime you push a change to a GitHub repository.
